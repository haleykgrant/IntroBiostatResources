We can do lots of operations in the console and have R print out the answer for us.\nFor example, if we want to check what 2+3 is, we can run the code:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhen you run the code above, it prints out the number 5. That’s great, but maybe I don’t want to have to type that every time I want to use those numbers. This is where R objects come in. For example, maybe I have a variable that I want to call x that will hold the number 2 and a different variable called y that will hold the number 3. I can do this with the following code\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: = vs &lt;-\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes you might see the operator &lt;- (for example x &lt;- 2) instead of the equals sign (=). This is an artifact of earlier versions of R when you had to use &lt;- to assign values to objects; both work now and = is shorter so I used it here 🙂\n\n\n\nNote that when you run this code, nothing happens! Or at least, that’s what it looks like. If we were running this in RStudio, we would see in the upper right quadrant under the “Environment” tab that we now have two objects, x and y, that have the values 2 and 3 respectively. To see this here, we can print out the values:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nCool! Now that x and y are placeholders for the numbers 2 and 3, we can use them just like numbers. For example, we can add them together, multiply them, divide, subtract, etc. If we want to save the value of x + y for later use, we can do that too!\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page."

    "section": "Types of Data",
    "text": "Types of Data\nIn the example above, we were using numeric variables. However, there are many different types of data in R. Some of the main types of data we will use are\n\nnumeric: numbers\ncharacter: character strings/words\nfactor: categorical variables that store data in levels\nlogical: binary TRUE/FALSE\nNA: stand-in for missing values\n\n\nNumeric\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nCharacter\nThis is a number so we can use the same types of functions as we used above on the object x_numeric (adding, subtracting, etc.).\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis is a character. Even though it looks like a number, the quotation marks tell R that we don’t want to treat this as the number 5. For example, maybe this is and identifier for hospital number 5 in a study. In this case, we probably don’t want to do typical calculations as if this was the number 5.\nExercise: See what happens when you try to multiply x_character by 2.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nError messages\nOh no! You should see the following error message:\n\nError: non-numeric argument to binary operator\n\nThis is how R is telling you that you’re trying to apply a function that requires a number to an object that isn’t a number. R gives helpful error messages like this when you try to run code that doesn’t work. Sometimes the language R uses is hard to understand, but you can always ask me or a TA what the error means, or search the error on Google!\nExercise: If you change x_character to x_numeric in the code above, you should see it works just fine!\n\n\nFactor\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nHere we can see that x_factor is a factor variable. It may not be obvious why this is useful yet, but it should hopefully become clear as the semester goes on. Factors are essentially a way that you can pick the order that categorical variable levels are presented and give the variables nice names for things like printing in a plot.\n\n\nLogical\nR has another type of data called “logical” values. These are binary TRUE/FALSE (can also abbreviate with T/F) that let you know if a statement is true or false. This can be really useful when we want to filter data. For example, if we want to filter data to everyone over the age of 50, we can check the logical variables to check if age is greater than or equal to 50.\nIn the example below we’ll make a new variable to tell us if x_numeric from above is equal to the number 5.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nExercise: Try changing the value in the code above to check if x_numeric is equal to the number 4 to see how the value would change.\n\n\nMissing Values\nR has a special way of denoting missing values. In R, these show up as NA values. For example, if you have a data set with 100 individuals’ height, weight, and age, if you weren’t able to get the values measured for some of the individuals, those values should show up as NA values to indicate that they are missing.\nNote: this is different from “NA” the character. R will change the color of NA when you type it in your code to show that this is a special kind of variable.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nExercise: Try multiplying the x_missing variable by 2 and see what happens.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nGenerally any kind of functions applied to missing values return another NA value unless the function has a special way of handling missing values.\n\nThe is.na() function\nThere is a special function in R that can help you check if a value is a missing value. This funciton is is.na(). To see how it works, try running the code below:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page."

    "title": "Tutorial 2: R Objects, Functions, and Packages",
    "section": "R Packages",
    "text": "R Packages\n\nWhat is an R package\nR comes with a lot of great built-in, ready-to-use functions, but there are probably lots of other functions that we might want to use that don’t come built in to R. You can write your own functions in R if you want, but usually someone else has already written the kind of function you want to use. This is where R packages come in.\nThe following description of R packages comes from this R Basics Tutorial from R-Ladies Sydney.\n\nA package is a bundle of code that a generous person has written, tested, and then given away. Most of the time packages are designed to solve a specific problem, so they to pull together functions related to a particular data science problem (e.g., data wrangling, visualisation, inference). Anyone can write a package, and you can get packages from lots of different places, but for beginners the best thing to do is get packages from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network. It’s easier than any of the alternatives, and people tend to wait until their package is stable before submitting it to CRAN, so you’re less likely to run into problems. You can find a list of all the packages on CRAN here.\n\n\n\nHow to install R packages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Installing packages\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should generally only need to install a package one time on your computer. Installing packages is just like downloading any other piece of software on your computer; once you’ve downloaded it once, you have it on your computer unless you delete it.\nInstalling packages is different from loading packages, which we’ll get to next.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading Packages\nJust because you installed an R package once, doesn’t mean you want to use it for every task you do in R. Because of this, R will automatically load a small set of default packages when you launch a new session, but you’ll need to tell it if you want to use any additional packages. To load a library that isn’t loaded by default, we use the following code:\n\nlibrary(package_name)\n\nThink of installing and loading R packages as similar to using the Microsoft Word application on your computer. Once you have installed Microsoft Word once on your computer, you have the software available to you. But that doesn’t mean Word is always running on your computer. In order to use the functions of Word, you have to open the application. This is essentially what we are doing when we load a library–we’re opening it up so we can use it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: loading packages\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother reason we don’t automatically load all of the packages we’ve ever installed on our computer is because sometimes different packages have functions that are named the same thing (this is because R is open-source)! When this happens, it can be frustrating to try to figure out which version of the function R is using and requires extra code to tell R which version of the function you want to use. To avoid this it is best practice to only load the packages you currently need.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading uninstalled packages\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember that you have to install an R package once before you ever use it. After you’ve installed it once, you don’t need to re-install it, you just need to load it into your session to have access to its contents.\nIf you ever run a line of code like this:\n\nlibrary(mypackage)\n\nand get an error message like this:\n\nError in library(mypackage) : there is no package called ‘mypackage’\n\nthis means you are trying to load a package you haven’t installed yet and you need to run install.packages(\"mypackage\") once first.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tidyverse package\nThe R tidyverse package is a very useful suite of packages that make data manipulation and visualization clean and efficient. To see all of the packages included in the tidyverse package run the following code:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint\n\n\n\n\n\nThis should produce an error when you first try to run it. Can you tell why?\n\n\n\n\n\nError message\nOh no! We got another error message. You should see the following error:\n\nError: could not find function “tidyverse_packages”\n\nThis is R’s way of telling you that you’re trying to use a function that it doesn’t have access to. The tidyverse_packages() function comes from the tidyverse package. I have already installed the tidyverse for you in the setup of this tutorial, but I didn’t load it. Even if you have the tidyverse installed on your computer, that doesn’t mean you have it loaded for R to use.\nTo give ourselves access to the functions from the tidyverse package, let’s add the line of code library(tidyverse) before the line of code in the chunk above. That should fix the problem.\nExercise: Add the line of code library(tidyverse) before the line of code in the chunk above and try rerunning the code chunk.\n\n\nThe pipe operator from the tidyverse\nOne of the unique functions provided by the tidyverse is called the “pipe operator.” The pipe operator looks like this: %&gt;%. The pipe operator is a way of stringing together a bunch of functions and the purpose is to make your code easier to read.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: %&gt;% vs |&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent updates to R also let you use |&gt; as the pipe operator, but I’m old so I still use %&gt;% 🙂\n\n\n\nTo see an example of this, consider the following task:\nWe want to know how many unique values are contained in the vector x_vector.\nTo do this, we can start by having R grab the unique values in x_vector using unique(x_vector).This will give us a vector of the unique values in x_vector. Then, we can print the length of the output of unique(x_vector) to get the number of unique values.\nTo do this, we could define a new intermediate vector called x_unique to hold the vector of unique values in x_vector, or we can just use multiple functions simulatneously by nesting the parentheses:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNotice how the order of operations was:\n\nStart with your input x_vector\nDetermine the unique values of x_vector\nCalculate length of unique(x_vector)\n\nHowever, reading left-to-right we see the last step first. This can get particularly confusing when we want to apply multiple sequential functions to the same object in R. Imagine we had wanted to do 3 more functions! This would have read as:\n\nfunction3(function2(function1(length(unique(x_vector)))))\n\nThat’s a lot of parentheses and it’s hard to even figure out where the operation starts!\nTo fix this, we can use the pipe operator:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSee how the output is the same but the order of operations is much clearer in this example? It’s clear that we start with the object x_vector, which we then extract just the unique values from, then finally calculate the length of just the vector of unique values.\nIn the example above with an extra 3 functions at the end, this would read as:\n\nx_vector %&gt;% unique() %&gt;% length() %&gt;% function1() %&gt;% function2()  %&gt;% function3()\n\nStill long, but a lot easier to follow (at least I think so)!"

This is why I suggested creating a ‘data’ folder in your class folder. If you save all of the data files for this class in that folder, you can always use the same general syntax for telling R where your file is.\nFor this tutorial, we are working on the web, so R doesn’t have access to the local files on your device. I have included all of the data files we will be using in this tutorial on a webpage that we can access online. You may need to change this code slightly to when running code for your assignments in this class to work with your computer’s file structure.\n\nChecking your working directory\nOne good idea when you start working on a new analysis is to make sure you know where within your computer’s file structure you are working so you can figure out how to access various files.\nWe can use the function getwd() to have R print out the path to the directory (folder) we are currently working in.\nTry running the code in this block:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou should see the output is\n\n“/home/web_user”\n\nThis is because we are working in R on the web. This is telling us that we are in a subdirectory of the “home” directory called “web_user”. That is, “web_user” is a directory (folder) inside the larger directory (folder) called “home”. You read file paths from left to right\nTry running this in your Console in RStudio on your computer, and you should see a file path that corresponds to the file structure on your computer.\n\n\nList files in working directory\nTo check the files that are present in our current directory, we can use the function list.files() to list out all of the files that are stored in the directory where we are currently working.\nTry running the code in this block:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe output should look something like this:\n\n[1] “Rplots.pdf” “cdc.samp.csv” “census.rda” “dds.xlsx”\n\nThis tells us that there are 4 files that we have access to in this directory:\n\na file called “cdc.samp.csv”\na file called “census.rda”\na file called “dds.xlsx”\n\nThere are the data files that we will be working with in this tutorial."

    "text": "Importing Data\n\nReading in a csv file\nTo read in a csv file to R, we use the function read.csv(). There is a similar function in the tidyverse package called read_csv() that you could also use. We’ll go ahead and use the tidyverse version.\nThe syntax to use this function is:\n\nname_for_data = read_csv(\"path_to_data\")\n\n\nHere name_for_data is any name you choose to call the data frame. It can be helpful to give it a name that is relevant to the data, but you can call it whatever you want (with some limits, for example the name can’t start with a number).\n\"path_to_data\" is the file path that will tell R where to look for your data. You will see more examples of this in class, but for this example, the files are in our working directory so we don’t need any long file paths to navigate through different directories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssigning a name\n\n\n\nWarning: Naming the object is very important!\nIf you forget to choose a name for your dataframe, R will read in the data and print it, but it won’t save it as an object. If you just use read_csv() without the name_for_data = part, you won’t be able to manipulate or analyze the data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuplicate names\n\n\n\nAnother warning: If you read in two datasets and accidentally give them the same name, the one you run second will overwrite the first one! Sometimes this is useful; for example, if you just want to make a change to a dataset (more on this later). But be careful and when in doubt, give new dataframes different names!\n\n\nLet’s try reading in the “cdc_samp.csv” file and give the dataframe the name cdc.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint (if you get an error)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you get the following error:\n\nError: could not find function “read_csv”\n\nyou forgot to load the tidyverse package!\nAdd a line of code above your read_csv() line to load the tidyverse (library(tidyverse)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\nViewing your data\nGreat! We’ve now read our first data file into R. But how do we know if it worked?\nWe’re going to take a brief detour to talk about taking a first look at your data before we move on to importing data from other files types.\n\nThe head() function\nIn RStudio, you should be able to see a new object in your ‘Environment’ tab in the upper-right quadrant of your screen when you import a new data set. Since we’re working on the web, we’ll go ahead and use a different function to take a look at the top few rows of the dataset. The function that will allow us to do this is head() that shows us the top few entries of a data frame, vector, or list.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint (if you get an error)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you get the following error:\n\nError: object ‘cdc’ not found\n\nthis is R’s way of telling you that you don’t currently have an object loaded into your environment called ‘cdc’.\nWhen you see an error like this, you should make sure the code used to import the data worked properly and that you don’t have any spelling errors (R is case sensitive so you have to be very careful to spell things exactly correctly).\nMake sure you were able to successfully run the code above with the read_csv() function without any errors before running this code block.\n\n\n\nAwesome! Here we see the top 6 rows of the cdc dataframe. There are 9 columns: genhlth, exerany, hlthplan, smoke100, height, weight, wtdesire, age, gender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntail() function\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to look at the last few entries of an R object, there is a similar function to the head() function called tail().\n\n\n\n\n\nThe skim() function\nAnother way we can start to take a look at the data is to use a function from the R package skmir. The function is called skim and gives us a nice overview of the contents included in our data.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThis function breaks our columns into groups based on the type of variable they are. Here we see that genhlth and gender are characters and the rest are being treated as numeric (even though it looks like we may have a few other binary variables that were coded as 0/1—more on this later). The summary information gives us a snapshot of the contents of each column in the data. More information about the specific sections of the output can be found below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding skim() output\n\n\n\n\n\nThe columns for categorical variables are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nn_missing\nthe number of rows with missing value (NA) in the corresponding columns\n\n\ncomplete_rate\nproportion of rows that are not missing (not NAs)\n\n\nmin\nthe minimum character length of values in the column\n\n\nmax\nthe maximum character length of values in the column\n\n\nempty\nthe number of empty characters in the column\n\n\nn_unique\nthe number of unique values in the column\n\n\nwhitespace\nthe number of rows containing only white space in the column\n\n\n\nThe columns for numeric variables are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nn_missing\nthe number of rows with missing value (NA) in the corresponding columns\n\n\ncomplete_rate\nproportion of rows that are not missing (not NAs)\n\n\nmean\nthe mean (average) value of the non-missing values in the column\n\n\nsd\nthe standard deviation of the non-missing values in the column\n\n\np0\nthe minimum value observed in the column\n\n\np25\nthe 25th percentile of values observed in the column\n\n\np50\nthe median (50th percentile) of values observed in the column\n\n\np75\nthe 75th percentile of values observed in the column\n\n\np100\nthe maximum value observed in the column\n\n\nhist\na histogram showing the shape of the distribution of values in the column\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to reading in data from various file types…\n\n\n\nReading in an Excel file\nWe’ve successfully read in a csv file, but what if we get a different file type? For example, a lot of people store data in Excel. Can R handle those files? Yep! But we’re going to need to use a new package called the readxl package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReminder: Installing readxl\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember that if you don’t have this package installed on your local computer, you’ll need to install it before you can load and use it. I’ve already installed it here, but remember that to install the package you can just run install.packages(\"readxl\") in your console in R Studio.\n\n\n\nOnce we have the readxl package loaded, the syntax is very similar to read_csv() from above. There are a few different functions that could work from this package, but the most generic one is read_excel(). The syntax is:\n\nname_for_data = read_excel(\"path_to_data\")\n\nLet’s try it using our ‘dds.xlsx’ file!\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nAwesome! We can see that there are 6 columns in this data set: id, age.cohort, age, gender, expenditure, ethnicity.\nOnce you have the readxl package, importing Excel files works just like reading in csv files!\n\n\nImporting R data files\nThere is one other type of file that we will use from time to time in this class. This is a special kind of file called an R data file that saves R objects. The syntax is slightly different for these kinds of files.\nThe syntax for importing an R data file is:\n\nload(\"path_to_data\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nload()\n\n\n\nNotice how we didn’t include anything on the left side of the load() function here. We didn’t give the data a name!\n\n\nThe reason we don’t assign names to data loaded from an R data file is because these objects already come with a name. Since these are R objects that were saved specifically in a file format that R understands, they keep the name that they were given when they were first created in R. So how do we know what the name is? We can add an extra argument to this function called verbose. The syntax will become:\n\nload(\"path_to_data\", verbose = TRUE)\n\nThis tells R to print out the name of the data object once it is loaded so we know what to call it.\nLet’s see an example of this using our ‘census.rda’ file.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe can see the message:\n\nLoading objects:  census\n\nThis is telling us that the object we loaded came with the name census. This is the name we should use to refer to that data object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: file names vs object names\n\n\n\n\n\nThe name of the R object doesn’t have to match with the file name like it did in this example. The file name “census.rda” and the object name census are two independent things. However, it can be helpful to have the file name and object name match, so they often will by convention.\n\n\n\nFor example, we can take a look at the top few rows of data using the head() function again. This time we’ll just look at the top 3 by adding the argument n = 3.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nOther file types\nThere are other types of files that you may want to import into R. These include text files (.txt) and files from other statistical software packages like SAS (.sas7bdat) or stata (.dta). The syntax for reading in these files is very similar to reading in csv or Excel files so we won’t go into these data types in detail. There are lots of helpful tutorials and R documentation online if you ever need them (for example, this page goes through reading in files from multiple sources)."

Remember that R is case-sensitive so this can be a helpful function when you first start working with a data set.

    "title": "Tutorial 4: Data Frames in R",
    "section": "Making a new column",
    "text": "Making a new column\nAs with most things in R, there are multiple ways to make new columns in a data frame. I will be using the tidyverse syntax and functions to do this, but there are other ways.\nThe function in the tidyverse (and specifically, the dplyr package) to make a new column is mutate().\nThe syntax will be:\n\nmutate(new_column = some_function(existing_column))\n\nYou don’t need to use a pre-existing column to make the new column (you could just type out a vector with the new column values), but we generally will be using pre-existing columns to make new columns.\nFor example, we can see that there is a column called \"exerany\" in our data. This column indicates if the individual has exercised in the past month, where a 1 indicates if they have exercised in the past month and 0 indicates that they have not. This is a fairly common coding of binary variables, but unless you have the codebook readily available you wouldn’t know for sure which response (yes/no) corresponds to which value (1/0). It can be helpful to make new variable that reads as “Yes”/“No” instead of 1/0 for clarity.\nWe will make a new variable called \"exerany_f\" that is a factor variable that takes on the values 0 and 1 with the labels \"No exercise in past month\" and \"Exercise in past month\", respectively. We will use the values from the \"exerany\" variable to help us make the new variable.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nOh no! Why did we get an error?\nLet’s take a look at the error message:\n\nError: object ‘exerany’ not found\n\nThis error message is telling us that there isn’t an object called 'exerany' that R can find. This is because 'exerany' is the name of a column in our data frame cdc, not a standalone object.\nTo fix this error, we just need to tell R where to look for the variable called 'exerany'.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNotice that this printed out a data frame that now has 10 columns instead of the previous 9. The new column is the variable we just made, 'exerany_f'. You can’t see it because there is a limit to the number of columns printed, but there is a line telling us that there is 1 more variable: exerany_f &lt;fct&gt;, which means there is also a factor variable called exerany_f that isn’t being shown in the printed output.\nRight now, we haven’t actually saved the new column. To see this, let’s use the colnames() function we learned last time.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nBasically, mutate will add a new column and return a dataset (that then gets printed in your output). If you want to save the new variable to be able to use it later, we have to either update the cdc data frame or save this as a new data frame.\n\nSaving a new data frame\nTo save a new data frame we can use this code:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nUpdating the old data frame\nIf we don’t want to make a new data frame with a new name, we can also just update the original cdc object by replacing cdc_new in the code above with cdc. This will overwrite the old cdc object with the updated data frame with the additional column.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nGreat! If we want to take a look at the new column, we can use a function in the tidyverse package called select() to select just a few columns to look at. Let’s grab the original variable, exerany, and the new one, exerany_f and look at the first few entries to make sure we defined the new variable correctly.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nIt looks like this worked! The first 6 rows all had a 1 in exerany so they all show up as \"Exercise in the past month\" under exerany_f.\n\n\nUsing the $ symbol to grab a column\nAnother way to grab a specific column from a data frame is to use the $ symbol, using the following syntax\n\ndata_name$column_name\n\nThis will grab the column and treat it as a vector.\nFor example, if we want to grab the new column, exerany_f, and the old column, exerany, and take a look at the last few entries using the tail() function.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page."

The syntax this time will be:\n\nmutate(existin_column = some_function(existing_column))\n\nThis will overwrite the column with the new values.\nFor example, let’s say \"No exercise in the past month\" and \"Exercise in the past month\" are too long for our liking. Maybe we want to update this column so the values are just \"No exercise\" and \"Exercise\". We can do this with the following code:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nNotice that now the same column as before exerany_f has been updated from what we originally created.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning: Overwriting\n\n\n\nBe careful with updating existing column names (and other R objects for that matter)!\nIf you make a mistake, this will overwrite the old column, so you won’t have access to the original contents anymore and you will have to rerun some of your code (like when you first read in the data) to reset the code and try again."

To do this, I can use the filter() function (also within the dplyr package from the tidyverse).\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nUsing the filter function, we can then run functions just on the subsetted data.

    "section": "ggplot syntax",
    "text": "ggplot syntax\nThe ggplot2 package within the tidyverse suite of packages utilizes similar syntax to create multiple types of graphs.\nAll ggplot2 plots will begin with a call to the ggplot() functions, to which you will supply the data you will be using to make the plot and specify the variables (columns) you would like to use in the plot. We can then add extra features on top of this base plot using other ggplot2 functions, strung together with the + symbol.\nI tend to use the following syntax:\n{data_name} %&gt;%\nggplot(aes(x = {x_axis_variable_name}, y = {y_axis_varible_name})) +\ngeom_{PLOT_TYPE}()\nThe code in the brackets {} are the things you should change based on your data and the type of plot you want to make.\nThe important thing to note about this code is that any variable you want to use from the data frame that you’ve supplied (in this example, data_name) must be wrapped within the aes() function. This is how R understands that you are trying to pull a column from the data frame and use it in the plot.\nThere are lots of different plots that ggplot2 can make, each with a different function. Some common ones that we will use are:\n\ngeom_histogram(): makes a histogram\ngeom_boxplot(): makes a boxplot\ngeom_bar(): makes a bar plot\ngeom_point(): makes a scatterplot\ngeom_qq(): makes a quantile-quantile (QQ) plot\n\nLet’s see some examples! We will use the census.rda data from Tutorial 3. I have already loaded the data for you. Reminder: the data frame is saved under the name census. Here’s a reminder of what the data look like:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nSince we are going to be using the ggplot2 functions, we need to load the tidyverse! I’m going to have this code auto-run but make sure when you’re working in RStudio that you type and run this line at the beginning of any R session/document that you want to use tidyverse functions for!\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\nHistograms\nA histogram is a visual representation of quantitative data in which the range of values is split into adjacent, non-overlapping intervals (or “bins”) and the number of observations that fall into each interval is counted and depicted on the plot.\nLet’s make a histogram of the variable total_personal_income.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nYou should see a few messages shown in the output. These messages aren’t errors (they aren’t a problem), but it’s good to know what they mean.\nThe first message:\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\nis telling us that the geom_histogram() function defaulted to splitting the range into 30 intervals (bins). We can change this if we want using either the bins argument to specify the number of bins desired, or the bindwidth argument to specify the size of the bins/intervals, in geom_histogram().\nFor example, if we want to make more, smaller width bins we could specify bins = 50 instead of the default of 30 using the following code:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWe could also specify the size of the bins, rather than the number of bins. For example, since this variable refers to annual income, maybe we would want to show bins of size $10,000. Specifying the binwidth argument is highly data-dependent (we wouldn’t want to use a bin size of 10,000 if the variable was height measured in inches, for example 🙂 ). Here’s an example of specifying binwidth:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThe other message is a warning message:\n\nWarning: Removed 108 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range (`stat_bin()`)\n\nThis is R’s way of telling us that some of the rows were removed and were not included in the plot. We can see that 108 observations (rows) were removed for plotting. This is generally because there are missing values. The ggplot2 functions don’t have any way of plotting missing values, so they get skipped in these plotting functions.\nTo see that these observations came from missing values, we can look a bit more into the data. For example, we can count the number of rows for which the column total_personal_income is an NA value using the is.na() function:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSum of logical values\n\n\n\n\n\nNote here that is.na(census$total_personal_income) returns a vector of TRUE/FALSE (logical) values. When you take the sum of TRUE/FALSE values in R, it returns the number that are TRUE.\nFor example:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nWe can see from these histograms that we have a highly right-skewed variable. There are a lot of observations under $100,000 (1e+05) and then a handful of observations all the way to over $400,000.\n\n\nBox plots\nAnother way we can visualize quantitative data is using box plots. Box plots can be particularly helpful if you want to compare the distribution of a particular quantitative variable across different groups. For example, maybe we want to compare the distribution of total_personal_income across different levels of marital_status. We can do this with box plots.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHere we can see that the labels on the x-axis are overlapping, making it hard to read the plot. We’ll get more into this later when we go over other aesthetic changes we can make to plots made with ggplot.\n\n\n\n\nBar plots\nA bar plot is a tool to visualize a categorical variable. It is similar to a histogram in that it shows the number of times each level of a variable is observed in a data set. For example, in the plot above we showed the distribution of personal income across marital status, but maybe we want to know how many people fell into each of these marital status categories. We can use a bar plot for this.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nFrom this plot we can see that “Never married/single” is the most commonly observed marital status in our data, followed closely by “Married/spouse present”. The status “Separated” was the last common, followed by “Married/spouse absent”. The categories “Divorced” and “Widowed” were somewhere in between.\n\n\nScatter plots\nA scatter plot is a way of visualizing the relationship between two numeric variables. For example, if we want to know how total_personal_income relates to age in this data set, we can use a scatter plot. Here is some example code to make a scatter plot:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page."

    "text": "More ggplot aesthetic options\nSo far we have only made basic plots using ggplot2, however this package makes it really easy to make much nicer looking plots without too much extra coding. We can do things like change the background color, add titles and subtitles, change the axis labels, and much more. I’ll go over a few of these options but much more can be found online at resources like these: ggplot tutorial, ggplot reference page\nWe will return to our side-by-side box plot example showing the total personal income by marital status to demonstrate how we can make the plot look a little nicer.\n\nFacets\nOne really nice feature of ggplot2 is the ability to make multiple plots of the same variable(s) across different subgroups using something called “facets”. For example, let’s say we want to make the same box plots we did before showing the distribution of personal income by marital status, but we want to split by sex to see if there are any different trends between male and female participants in our data set. We can do this using the function facet_wrap():\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nFaceting lets us compare trends across groups. We can facet across more than just one variable, too. For, example, we could facet across both sex and race (column name race_general). In this case, I like to use a slightly different function called facet_grid() because it makes the labeling a little easier to follow.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution: Busy plots\n\n\n\nNotice that this busied up the plot a lot. It’s generally only a good idea to use multiple faceting variables if each only has a few (2-3) possible levels to make sure our figure is still interpretable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacets: different scales\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes you’ll notice that when you add facets to a plot, that not every facet takes up the full range of values on either the x-axis or y-axis, so the plots don’t use space very effectively. If you want to change this, you can the following arguments to the facet_wrap() function:\n\nscales = \"free_x : to allow the x-axis to have different scales (ranges/degree of zoom) across the plots\nscales = \"free_y : to allow the y-axis to have different scales (ranges/degree of zoom) across the plots\nscales = \"free : to allow both the x- and y-axes to have different scales (ranges/degree of zoom) across the plots\n\nExample:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\nLabels/titles\nOne issue with our plot right now is that it doesn’t have a title and the axis labels are column names with underscores. If we wanted to include this figure in a paper, we might want to change these. We can do this by adding the labs() function to the plot to update the plot labels.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nThese labels are a lot nicer than the default labels!\n\n\nBackground color\nDon’t like the grey grid background? You can change it, too! I like to use a black and white grid background or sometimes just a plain white background. You can achieve this by adding theme_bw() or theme_classic() to the plot. There are many other options for plot themes that you can find here: _____\n\nBlack and white grid with theme_bw()\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nWhite background with theme_classic()\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\nPlot colors\nYou can also add color to plots to help display information. For example, maybe we want to color the box plots by marital status or by sex to further emphasize a comparison that we’re trying to make. If you want to pick your own colors, see this reference for more information about plot colors in ggplot2.\n\nColor by marital status\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\nColor by sex\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing color to display information\n\n\n\nGiven that some people have trouble distinguishing color, it is best practice not to have color be the only way in which information is portrayed.\n\n\n\n\nStatic colors\nYou can also change colors without using variables from data. For example, you could make all of the box plots blue by including color=\"blue\" to the geom_boxplot() function. If you are just trying to change the color but not trying to use color to indicate the value of a variable, put this argument doesn’t need to go inside an aes() function. There are lots of colors to choose from in ggplot (link).\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolor vs fill\n\n\n\n\n\nFor some types of plots there is an additional argument fill that you can use to color parts of the plot. For example, in bar plots and histograms, changing the color argument will change the outline color of the bars while changing the fill argument will change the color inside the bars.\nExample:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormatting axis text\nAs we noted before, the text on the x-axis of our box plots showing the different values of marital_status are overlapping, making it hard to read the plot. One way we can fix this is using the following code to rotate the text:\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking up technical code\n\n\n\nThis code is starting to get pretty technical.

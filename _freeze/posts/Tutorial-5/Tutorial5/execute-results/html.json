Specifically, we will learn about\n\n-   General `ggplot` syntax\n-   Types of plots\n    -   histograms\n    -   box plots\n    -   bar plots\n    -   scatter plots\n-   More `ggplot` aesthetic options\n\n## `ggplot` syntax\n\nThe `ggplot2` package within the `tidyverse` suite of packages utilizes similar syntax to create multiple types of graphs.\n\nAll `ggplot2` plots will begin with a call to the `ggplot()` functions, to which you will supply the data you will be using to make the plot and specify the variables (columns) you would like to use in the plot. We can then add extra features on top of this base plot using other `ggplot2` functions, strung together with the `+` symbol.\n\nI tend to use the following syntax:\n\n`{data_name} %>%`\n\n`ggplot(aes(x = {x_axis_variable_name}, y = {y_axis_varible_name})) +`\n\n`geom_{PLOT_TYPE}()`\n\nThe code in the brackets `{}` are the things you should change based on your data and the type of plot you want to make.\n\nThe important thing to note about this code is that any variable you want to use from the data frame that you've supplied (in this example, `data_name`) must be wrapped within the `aes()` function. This is how R understands that you are trying to pull a column from the data frame and use it in the plot.\n\nThere are lots of different plots that `ggplot2` can make, each with a different function. Some common ones that we will use are:\n\n-   `geom_histogram()`: makes a histogram\n-   `geom_boxplot()`: makes a boxplot\n-   `geom_bar()`: makes a bar plot\n-   `geom_point()`: makes a scatterplot\n-   `geom_qq()`: makes a quantile-quantile (QQ) plot\n\nLet's see some examples! We will use the `census.rda` data from [Tutorial 3](https://haleykgrant.github.io/BIOST2041/posts/Tutorial-3/Tutorial3.html). I have already loaded the data for you. Reminder: the data frame is saved under the name `census`. Here's a reminder of what the data look like:\n\n```{webr-r}\n# show first few rows of census data\nhead(census)\n\n# show columns names\ncolnames(census)\n```\n\nSince we are going to be using the `ggplot2` functions, we need to load the `tidyverse`! I'm going to have this code auto-run but make sure when you're working in RStudio that you type and run this line at the beginning of any R session/document that you want to use `tidyverse` functions for!\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| warning: false\n#| autorun: true\n# load the tidyverse to gain access to ggplot2 functions (and others)\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n```\n\n### Histograms\n\nA histogram is a visual representation of quantitative data in which the range of values is split into adjacent, non-overlapping intervals (or \"bins\") and the number of observations that fall into each interval is counted and depicted on the plot.\n\nLet's make a histogram of the variable `total_personal_income`.\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| out-width: 80%\n#| out-height: 80%\n# make a histogram of total_personal_income\ncensus %>% # supply data frame\n  ggplot(aes(x = total_personal_income)) + # only need to specify x axis since y axis will be the count in each bin\n  geom_histogram() # make a histogram\n\n```\n\nYou should see a few messages shown in the output. These messages aren't errors (they aren't a problem), but it's good to know what they mean.\n\nThe first message:\n\n::: {style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n[\\`stat_bin()\\` using \\`bins = 30\\`. Pick better value with \\`binwidth\\`.]{style=\"color: #db4133; font-family: 'Monaco'; font-weight: 500; font-size: 12px;\"}\n:::\n\nis telling us that the `geom_histogram()` function defaulted to splitting the range into 30 intervals (bins). We can change this if we want using either the `bins` argument to specify the *number* of bins desired, or the `bindwidth` argument to specify the size of the bins/intervals, in `geom_histogram()`.\n\nFor example, if we want to make more, smaller width bins we could specify `bins = 50` instead of the default of 30 using the following code:\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| out-width: 80%\n#| out-height: 80%\n# make a histogram of total_personal_income with 50 bins\ncensus %>% # supply data frame\n  ggplot(aes(x = total_personal_income)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 50)\n\n```\n\nWe could also specify the *size* of the bins, rather than the *number* of bins. For example, since this variable refers to annual income, maybe we would want to show bins of size \\$10,000. Specifying the `binwidth` argument is highly data-dependent (we wouldn't want to use a bin size of 10,000 if the variable was height measured in inches, for example 🙂 ). Here's an example of specifying `binwidth`:\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| out-width: 80%\n#| out-height: 80%\n# make a histogram of total_personal_income with bins of size 10k\ncensus %>% # supply data frame\n  ggplot(aes(x = total_personal_income)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10000)\n```\n\nThe other message is a warning message:\n\n::: {style=\"text-align: center;\"}\n[Warning: Removed 108 rows containing non-finite outside the scale range (\\`stat_bin()\\`)]{style=\"color: #db4133; font-family: 'Monaco'; font-weight: 500; font-size: 12px;\"}\n:::\n\nThis is R's way of telling us that some of the rows were removed and were not included in the plot. We can see that 108 observations (rows) were removed for plotting. This is generally because there are missing values. The `ggplot2` functions don't have any way of plotting missing values, so they get skipped in these plotting functions.\n\nTo see that these observations came from missing values, we can look a bit more into the data. For example, we can count the number of rows for which the column `total_personal_income` is an `NA` value using the `is.na()` function:\n\n```{webr-r}\n# count NA rows in total_personal_income\nsum(is.na(census$total_personal_income))\n\n```\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Sum of logical values\n\nNote here that `is.na(census$total_personal_income)` returns a vector of `TRUE/FALSE` (logical) values. When you take the sum of `TRUE/FALSE` values in R, it returns the number that are `TRUE`.\n\nFor example:\n\n```{webr-r}\n# make a vector with logical values\nlogical_vector = c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)\n\n# take the sum\nsum(logical_vector)\n```\n:::\n\nWe can see from these histograms that we have a highly right-skewed variable. There are a lot of observations under \\$100,000 (1e+05) and then a handful of observations all the way to over \\$400,000.\n\n### Box plots\n\nAnother way we can visualize quantitative data is using box plots. Box plots can be particularly helpful if you want to compare the distribution of a particular quantitative variable across different groups. For example, maybe we want to compare the distribution of `total_personal_income` across different levels of `marital_status`. We can do this with box plots.\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| out-width: 80%\n#| out-height: 80%\n# make box plot of total_personal_income across marital_status\ncensus %>% # supply data frame\n  ggplot(aes(x = marital_status, y = total_personal_income)) + # x axis is marital status, y axis is total_personal)income\n  geom_boxplot() # make a boxplot\n\n```\n\n::: callout-note\nHere we can see that the labels on the x-axis are overlapping, making it hard to read the plot. We'll get more into this later when we go over other aesthetic changes we can make to plots made with ggplot.\n:::\n\n### Bar plots\n\nA bar plot is a tool to visualize a categorical variable. It is similar to a histogram in that it shows the number of times each level of a variable is observed in a data set. For example, in the plot above we showed the distribution of personal income across marital status, but maybe we want to know how many people fell into each of these marital status categories. We can use a bar plot for this.\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| out-width: 80%\n#| out-height: 80%\n# make bar plot of  marital_status\ncensus %>% # supply data frame\n  ggplot(aes(x = marital_status)) + # only need to give x axis since y axis is counts\n  geom_bar() # make a bar plot\n\n```\n\nFrom this plot we can see that \"Never married/single\" is the most commonly observed marital status in our data, followed closely by \"Married/spouse present\". The status \"Separated\" was the last common, followed by \"Married/spouse absent\". The categories \"Divorced\" and \"Widowed\" were somewhere in between.\n\n### Scatter plots\n\nA scatter plot is a way of visualizing the relationship between two numeric variables. For example, if we want to know how `total_personal_income` relates to `age` in this data set, we can use a scatter plot. Here is some example code to make a scatter plot:\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| out-width: 80%\n#| out-height: 80%\n# make a scatter plot of total_personal_income by age\ncensus %>% # supply data frame\n  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = total_personal_income)) + # x-axis is age, y-axis is total_personal_income\n  geom_point() # make a bar plot\n\n```\n\n## More `ggplot` aesthetic options\n\nSo far we have only made basic plots using `ggplot2`, however this package makes it really easy to make much nicer looking plots without too much extra coding. We can do things like change the background color, add titles and subtitles, change the axis labels, and much more. I'll go over a few of these options but much more can be found online at resources like these: [ggplot tutorial](https://r-statistics.co/Complete-Ggplot2-Tutorial-Part1-With-R-Code.html), [ggplot reference page](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2.html)\n\nWe will return to our side-by-side box plot example showing the total personal income by marital status to demonstrate how we can make the plot look a little nicer.\n\n### Facets\n\nOne really nice feature of `ggplot2` is the ability to make multiple plots of the same variable(s) across different subgroups using something called \"facets\". For example, let's say we want to make the same box plots we did before showing the distribution of personal income by marital status, but we want to split by sex to see if there are any different trends between male and female participants in our data set. We can do this using the function `facet_wrap()`:\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| out-width: 80%\n#| out-height: 80%\n# make box plot of total_personal_income across marital_status\ncensus %>% # supply data frame\n  ggplot(aes(x = marital_status, y = total_personal_income)) + # x axis is marital status, y axis is total_personal)income\n  geom_boxplot() + # make a boxplot\n  facet_wrap( ~ sex) # make a separate plot for each level of the variable `sex` in the data\n\n```\n\nFaceting lets us compare trends across groups. We can facet across more than just one variable, too. For, example, we could facet across both sex and race (column name `race_general`). In this case, I like to use a slightly different function called `facet_grid()` because it makes the labeling a little easier to follow.\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| out-width: 80%\n#| out-height: 80%\n# make box plot of total_personal_income across marital_status\ncensus %>% # supply data frame\n  ggplot(aes(x = marital_status, y = total_personal_income)) + # x axis is marital status, y axis is total_personal)income\n  geom_boxplot() + # make a boxplot\n  facet_grid( sex ~ race_general) # make a separate plot for each combination of the variables `sex` and `race_general` in the data\n\n```\n\n::: callout-caution\n## Caution: Busy plots\n\nNotice that this busied up the plot a lot. It's generally only a good idea to use multiple faceting variables if each only has a few (2-3) possible levels to make sure our figure is still interpretable.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Facets: different scales\n\nSometimes you'll notice that when you add facets to a plot, that not every facet takes up the full range of values on either the x-axis or y-axis, so the plots don't use space very effectively. If you want to change this, you can the following arguments to the `facet_wrap()` function:\n\n-   `scales = \"free_x` : to allow the x-axis to have different scales (ranges/degree of zoom) across the plots\n-   `scales = \"free_y` : to allow the y-axis to have different scales (ranges/degree of zoom) across the plots\n-   `scales = \"free` : to allow both the x- and y-axes to have different scales (ranges/degree of zoom) across the plots\n\nExample:\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| out-height: 70%\n# make box plot of total_personal_income across marital_status\ncensus %>% # supply data frame\n  ggplot(aes(x = marital_status, y = total_personal_income)) + # x axis is marital status, y axis is total_personal)income\n  geom_boxplot() + # make a boxplot\n  facet_wrap( ~ sex, scales = \"free_y\") # make a separate plot for each level of the variable `sex` in the data\n\n```\n:::\n\n### Labels/titles\n\nOne issue with our plot right now is that it doesn't have a title and the axis labels are column names with underscores. If we wanted to include this figure in a paper, we might want to change these. We can do this by adding the `labs()` function to the plot to update the plot labels.\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| out-width: 80%\n#| out-height: 80%\n# make box plot of total_personal_income across marital_status\ncensus %>% # supply data frame\n  ggplot(aes(x = marital_status, y = total_personal_income)) + # x axis is marital status, y axis is total_personal)income\n  geom_boxplot() + # make a boxplot\n  facet_wrap( ~ sex) + # make a separate plot for each combination of the variables `sex` and `race_general` in the data\n  labs(title = \"Personal Income by Marital Status\",\n       subtitle = \"Split by Sex\",\n       x = \"Marital Status\",\n       y = \"Total Personal Income ($)\")\n\n```\n\nThese labels are a lot nicer than the default labels!\n\n### Background color\n\nDon't like the grey grid background? You can change it, too! I like to use a black and white grid background or sometimes just a plain white background. You can achieve this by adding `theme_bw()` or `theme_classic()` to the plot. There are many other options for plot themes that you can find here: \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n#### Black and white grid with `theme_bw()`\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| out-width: 80%\n#| out-height: 80%\n# make box plot of total_personal_income across marital_status\ncensus %>% # supply data frame\n  ggplot(aes(x = marital_status, y = total_personal_income)) + # x axis is marital status, y axis is total_personal)income\n  geom_boxplot() + # make a boxplot\n  facet_wrap( ~ sex) + # make a separate plot for each combination of the variables `sex` and `race_general` in the data\n  labs(title = \"Personal Income by Marital Status\",\n       subtitle = \"Split by Sex\",\n       x = \"Marital Status\",\n       y = \"Total Personal Income ($)\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n```\n\n#### White background with `theme_classic()`\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| out-width: 80%\n#| out-height: 80%\n# make box plot of total_personal_income across marital_status\ncensus %>% # supply data frame\n  ggplot(aes(x = marital_status, y = total_personal_income)) + # x axis is marital status, y axis is total_personal)income\n  geom_boxplot() + # make a boxplot\n  facet_wrap( ~ sex) + # make a separate plot for each combination of the variables `sex` and `race_general` in the data\n  labs(title = \"Personal Income by Marital Status\",\n       subtitle = \"Split by Sex\",\n       x = \"Marital Status\",\n       y = \"Total Personal Income ($)\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n```\n\n### Plot colors\n\nYou can also add color to plots to help display information. For example, maybe we want to color the box plots by marital status or by sex to further emphasize a comparison that we're trying to make. If you want to pick your own colors, see [this reference](https://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-color.html) for more information about plot colors in `ggplot2`.\n\n#### Color by marital status\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| out-width: 80%\n#| out-height: 80%\n# make box plot of total_personal_income across marital_status\ncensus %>% # supply data frame\n  ggplot(aes(x = marital_status, y = total_personal_income, color = marital_status)) + # x axis is marital status, y axis is total_personal)income\n  geom_boxplot() + # make a boxplot\n  facet_wrap( ~ sex) + # make a separate plot for each combination of the variables `sex` and `race_general` in the data\n  labs(title = \"Personal Income by Marital Status\",\n       subtitle = \"Split by Sex\",\n       x = \"Marital Status\",\n       y = \"Total Personal Income ($)\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n```\n\n#### Color by sex\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| out-width: 80%\n#| out-height: 80%\n# make box plot of total_personal_income across marital_status\ncensus %>% # supply data frame\n  ggplot(aes(x = marital_status, y = total_personal_income, color = sex)) + # x axis is marital status, y axis is total_personal)income\n  geom_boxplot() + # make a boxplot\n  facet_wrap( ~ sex) + # make a separate plot for each combination of the variables `sex` and `race_general` in the data\n  labs(title = \"Personal Income by Marital Status\",\n       subtitle = \"Split by Sex\",\n       x = \"Marital Status\",\n       y = \"Total Personal Income ($)\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n```\n\n::: callout-warning\n## Using color to display information\n\nGiven that some people have trouble distinguishing color, it is best practice not to have color be the **only way** in which information is portrayed.\n:::\n\n#### Static colors\n\nYou can also change colors without using variables from data. For example, you could make all of the box plots blue by including `color=\"blue\"` to the `geom_boxplot()` function. If you are just trying to change the color but not trying to use color to indicate the value of a variable, put this argument doesn't need to go inside an `aes()` function. There are lots of colors to choose from in ggplot ([link](https://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/colour)).\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| out-width: 80%\n#| out-height: 80%\n# make box plot of total_personal_income across marital_status\ncensus %>% # supply data frame\n  ggplot(aes(x = marital_status, y = total_personal_income)) + # x axis is marital status, y axis is total_personal)income\n  geom_boxplot(color = \"blue\") + # make a boxplot\n  facet_wrap( ~ sex) + # make a separate plot for each combination of the variables `sex` and `race_general` in the data\n  labs(title = \"Personal Income by Marital Status\",\n       subtitle = \"Split by Sex\",\n       x = \"Marital Status\",\n       y = \"Total Personal Income ($)\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n```\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## `color` vs `fill`\n\nFor some types of plots there is an additional argument `fill` that you can use to color parts of the plot. For example, in bar plots and histograms, changing the `color` argument will change the *outline color* of the bars while changing the `fill` argument will change the *color inside the bars*.\n\nExample:\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| out-width: 70%\n#| out-height: 70%\n# make bar plot of  marital_status\ncensus %>% # supply data frame\n  ggplot(aes(x = marital_status)) + # only need to give x axis since y axis is counts\n  geom_bar(color = \"blue\") + # make a bar plot\n  labs(title = \"Changing `color` argument\")\n\n# make bar plot of  marital_status\ncensus %>% # supply data frame\n  ggplot(aes(x = marital_status)) + # only need to give x axis since y axis is counts\n  geom_bar(fill = \"blue\") + # make a bar plot\n  labs(title = \"Changing `fill` argument\")\n\n```\n:::\n\n### Formatting axis text\n\nAs we noted before, the text on the x-axis of our box plots showing the different values of `marital_status` are overlapping, making it hard to read the plot. One way we can fix this is using the following code to rotate the text:\n\n```{webr-r}\n#| out-width: 80%\n#| out-height: 80%\n# make box plot of total_personal_income across marital_status\ncensus %>% # supply data frame\n  ggplot(aes(x = marital_status, y = total_personal_income)) + # x axis is marital status, y axis is total_personal)income\n  geom_boxplot() + # make a boxplot\n  facet_wrap( ~ sex) + # make a separate plot for each combination of the variables `sex` and `race_general` in the data\n  labs(title = \"Personal Income by Marital Status\",\n       subtitle = \"Split by Sex\",\n       x = \"Marital Status\",\n       y = \"Total Personal Income ($)\") +\n  theme_bw() + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1))\n\n```\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Looking up technical code\n\nThis code is starting to get pretty technical. You probably won't memorize this (I haven't! I look up how to do it every time I need to rotate axis labels, including just now while I was making this tutorial 🙂 ).\n\n**You aren't expected to know how to do this from memory**; you can use old example code or search online references/forums for help with this kind of thing.\n:::\n",
